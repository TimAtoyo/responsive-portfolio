## Portfolio Page

**Overview**

This is a portfolio page that showcases my skills and experience as a developer. I have implemented this page myself, using the following criteria:

* **Page Load:** Upon loading the page, the user is presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and my contact information.
* **Navigation:** Clicking on any of the navigation links smoothly scrolls the user to the corresponding section of the page.
* **Work Section:** The "Work" section showcases titled images of my applications. The first application is displayed with a larger image size compared to the others.
* **Application Links:** Clicking on an application image redirects the user to the deployed version of that application.(This hasnt been implemented yet)
* **Responsiveness:** The layout of the portfolio website is responsive and adapts to different viewports, ensuring a consistent user experience across various screen sizes and devices.

**Design Choices**

I have chosen to express myself with the color pallet used in the design of this page, as well as other design choices such as the hover effect on the navigation bar and the border area around the work section. I plan to build on this portfolio page as time goes on, adding more projects and features.

**How to Use**

To use this portfolio page, simply navigate to the different sections using the navigation bar at the top of the page. To view a project in more detail (coming soon), click on the corresponding image in the "Work" section.

**Contact Me**

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, hang in there. I will be adding a contact form soom :).

**Additional Notes**

* This portfolio page is still under development, but I am excited to share it with the world. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new things, so please feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or suggestions.
* I am also open to new opportunities, so if you are looking for a talented and motivated developer, please consider me.
